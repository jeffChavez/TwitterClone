TwitterClone
============
I worked with Tuan to create a tab bar controller for the paired programming challenge. Though we were able to create two tabs(a home and user timeline) and navigage bewteen the two, we realized that the user timeline was not receiving a screenname value like it did when navigating from the TweetViewController to the UserTimelineViewController via IBAction photobuttonPressed. Until this problem is solved the feature has been omitted. I did end up implenting the pull to refresh functionality on the HomeViewController though, it works great!
